Hello, welcome to my solution to the power plant challenge , 

in this document I will explain how to launch the API and make it visible in port 8888

Steps to follow:

1) open a terminal in the respsitory and do python3 main.py, the server should be open


when the server is open, it will listen to the POST requests with the payload and give
back the result

CO2 is taken into consideration in the calculation.
